      <p> My research aims to answer a fundamental question within phonology:
        which units of representation provide the best fit to the
        cross-linguistic phonological patterns that we observe? I focus
        primarily on investigating the advantages and insights gained by
        adopting sub-segmental units of representation known as gestures. One of
        the aims of my research involves the reanalysis of persistent
        theoretical puzzles in phonology within the framework of gestural
        phonology. I also work to build on some of the core representational
        concepts of gestural phonology. This includes modifying and expanding
        upon the established set of gestural parameters, proposing novel types
        of relations that exist between gestures, and developing a phonological
        grammar that operates over gestural representations.</p>
      <p>On this page, you'll find some of my written work and conference
        presentation materials, organized thematically.</p>
      <h2>Harmony</h2>
      <p> Harmony is a widely studied phonological phenomenon that continues to
        spark debate regarding the nature of triggers (segments that initiate
        harmony), undergoers (segments that are affected by harmony), so-called
        neutral segments (segments that apparently do not participate in
        harmony), and directionality (whether a trigger affects preceding or
        following segments), among other issues. I address all of these issues
        via formal phonological analysis and computational modeling. The
        Gestural Harmony Model that I propose provides long-sought-after
        solutions to the representation of harmony that are not available to
        many segment- and feature-based analyses.</p>
      <p>In addition to the written works cited below, my 2018 USC dissertation,
        <em>Harmony in Gestural Phonology</em>, is available on <a href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/004180">Lingbuzz</a>.<br>

      <h2>Phonological Exceptionality</h2>
      <p>Phonological exceptionality refers to cases in which individual
        segments or lexical items pattern in an idiosyncratic or unpredictable
        way with respect to one or more phonological processes. My research in
        this area gives the concept of gestural strength an expanded role as not
        only a source of coarticulatory influence but also as a phonologically
        active element of representation. The concept of contrastive gestural
        strength can be used to reanalyze cases of phonological idiosyncrasy
        previously thought to be the result of absolute surface neutralization,
        derivational opacity, or lexical exceptionality. Portions of this work
        have been conducted in collaboration with <a href="http://reedblaylock.com/">Reed
          Blaylock</a>.</p>

      <h2>Machine Learning</h2>
      <p>Due to the gradient/continuous nature of many gestural parameters,
        gestural representations are quite powerful and are able to generate
        many patterns that may not be derivable within feature-based
        phonological frameworks. However, in order for a phonological pattern to
        be crosslinguistically attested, it must not only be derivable within a
        phonological framework, but also learnable within that framework. In
        collaboration with <a href="https://dornsife.usc.edu/ohara">Charlie
          O'Hara</a>, I have developed a learning algorithm to computationally
        model the acquisition of gestural parameters in order to shed light on
        which phonological patterns are learnable within the gestural phonology
        framework.</p>

      <h2>Computational Complexity</h2>
      <p> Formal language theory provides a way of hierarchically classifying
        phonological input-output mappings according to their relative degrees
        of computational complexity. In collaboration with <a href="https://dornsife.usc.edu/ohara">Charlie
          O'Hara</a> and <a href="http://blogs.umass.edu/alamont/">Andrew
          Lamont</a>, I have investigated how the formal complexity of different
        types of mappings, especially those involving featural and tonal
        spreading, affects cross-linguistic typological patterns. In particular,
        we focus on determining the upper bound on the complexity of attested
        spreading patterns.<br>

      <h2>Morphological Consonant Mutation</h2>
      <p>Morphological consonant mutation is characterized by the marking of
        morphological information via alteration of a root consonant rather than
        the addition of an overt affixal segment or string. I claim that by
        adopting gestural representations it is possible to represent
        morphological consonant mutation as the affixation of a gesture rather
        than a feature that must dock with a segment in the stem. This both
        eliminates the need to distinguish between segmental and featural
        affixation, and makes more restricted typological predictions regarding
        what kinds of consonant mutations we can expect to observe.<br>

      <h2>Speech Production</h2>
      <p> In my work on articulatory phonetics, I use the results of phonetic
        experimentation (usually taking the form of real-time MRI data) to
        inform phonological analysis and representation. The work I have
        conducted in this area is aimed at answering questions regarding the
        often complex nature of lingual control during the production of coronal
        consonants, especially liquids. This work was conducted as part of my
        membership in USC's <a href="https://sail.usc.edu/span/">Speech
          Production and Articulation kNowledge (SPAN) group</a> and in
        collaboration with several of its <a href="https://sail.usc.edu/span/team.html">members</a>.<br>
